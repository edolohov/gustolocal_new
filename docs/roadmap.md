## Business Automation Roadmap

Phase 1 (2–3 weeks)
- Data model and storage: Airtable MVP + CSV templates
- WooCommerce order parser spec (no code yet)
- Report specs: kitchen, courier, labels
- Feedback flow design (Telegram + QR + form)
- Release process draft for WordPress

Phase 2 (3–5 weeks)
- Implement WooCommerce → Airtable sync (serverless or WP plugin)
- Generate kitchen/courier reports from normalized data
- Launch feedback bot/forms and link to orders
- Basic AI-assisted menu draft using historical data and constraints

Phase 3 (4–6 weeks)
- Advanced menu optimization, per-client preferences
- Predictive prep quantities, ingredient consolidation
- Staging environment + CI/CD for WordPress
- Migrate to managed DB if/when needed (Postgres) and keep Airtable as UI

KPIs
